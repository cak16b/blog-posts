### The Sultan's Health
Rumours are still current that the Sultan's condition is most precarious, and that a fatal issue may occur at almost any moment.

It is well-known that Dr. Bier, Dr. Bergmann's colleague, who will in all probability succeed the celebrated German professor as physician to the Emperor William, is at Constantinple in constant attendance on Abdul Hamid.

By the Sultan's special order Dr. Bier has been installed in a pavilion at Yildiz Kiosk, close to the palace. The doctor has access to the Sultan at all times, without having to demand an audience. Dr. Bier has, moreover, been appointed chief physician not only of the German hospital in Constantinple but of all the Turkish military hospitals, which confers on his authority over the whole Turkish military medical staff.
